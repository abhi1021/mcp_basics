### Code:

 - mcp_server.py, needs .env file and must install ddgs, crawl4ai and tavily
 - llm_gatewayV3

Build an agent that passes all four target queries. The architecture is described above; the implementation is the student's task.

### Required.

 - Four code modules with clear separation of concerns: memory.py, perception.py, decision.py, action.py. Plus an agent6.py (or any name) that wires them together in a loop. Plus a schemas.py containing the Pydantic models. Plus the MCP server from earlier sessions.
 - All four target queries must produce correct final answers. The expected answers and iteration counts are documented above. Queries that exceed twice the expected iteration count are not considered passing; tune the prompts and the contracts until convergence is within bounds.
 - Memory must persist across runs in a file under state/. Query C requires the durable-memory behaviour: run 1 records the fact, run 2 reads it.
 - The four cognitive layers must each be backed by typed Pydantic contracts on their inputs and outputs. No free-form dict passing between roles. No regex on LLM output.
 - The LLM gateway V3 must be the substrate for every LLM call. No direct calls to provider SDKs.
 - The state/ directory must be cleanable between assignment attempts.

### Constraints.
 - Pydantic v2 on every boundary.
 - uv for Python dependency management and execution. No manual virtualenv activation.
 - MCP server stdio transport for tool calls. No reimplementing tool dispatch.
 - No third-party agentic frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, CrewAI). The architecture and the contracts are the assignment.

### Excluded. 
The assignment is not a summariser, a stock or crypto analyser, or any toy that completes in a single tool call. The four target queries are the assignment.
